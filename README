Hard Disk Simulator

== Description ==

The code is written in C++ and uses a variety of data structures to simulate a simplified model of a computer's hard disk memory system.

The main data structures used are:

    BitVector: A bit vector is used to track the status of each block on the disk (free/occupied).
    Inode: An inode is used to store information about a file, such as its name, size, and location on the disk.
    MainDir: A directory is used to store a list of file names and their corresponding inode numbers.
    OpenFileDescriptor: Keep tracked of open / unused file descriptors

The code implements the following operations:

    Create file: Creates a new file with the specified name and allocates space for it on the disk.
    Delete file: Deletes the specified file and frees the space it was using on the disk.
    Read file: Reads data from the specified file starting at the specified offset.
    Write file: Writes data to the specified file starting at the specified offset.
    List files: Lists all of the files on the disk.
    Format disk: Formats the disk, deleting all existing files.


==Features==

    Creates a simulated disk with a specified number of blocks.
    Supports file creation, deletion, rename and read/write operations.
    Uses a bit vector to track the status of each block on the disk (free/occupied).
    Implements a simple directory structure to store file names and inode numbers.


==output==:
        Displays the hard drive text and all the files which exist


==How to compile & run==:
